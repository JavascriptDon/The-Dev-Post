In this article, we'll use JSON Server, a **Node Module** that enables you to quickly develop an example REST API in 30 seconds.

Refer to this website [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to learn how to install Node.JS if you haven't already.

## Getting started

Start our new project by creating it in [visual studio code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with the file structure inside of your backend folder.

```
Mock API
 |- db.json
 |- server.js
 |- package.json
 |- package-lock.json
 |- node_modules
```

You can now add the following command below to install json-server with output on my machine.

```
// Install the JSON Server
npm install json-server
```

We must set the database as the router, construct the server, utilise the default middlewares for `server.js` port, and then listen. Running the start script will restore our previous functionality, but we now have much more flexibility.

```
const jsonServer = require('json-server');
const server = jsonServer.create();
const router = jsonServer.router('db.json');
const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Set default middlewares + default router
server.use(middlewares);
server.use(router);

// listen to port
server.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`JSON Server is running on ${port}`)
});

```

Create a database with some data for your `db.json` file.

## Run JSON Server

Open JSON Server, then launch your localhost database.

```
npx json-server --watch db.json
```

Requests can now be sent to `http://localhost:3000/quotes` and will return :

## Heroku Deployment | 3 Step Deployment

1. Create an account on [heroku](https://heroku.com).

2. Install the Heroku CLI on your [computer](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

3. Connect the Heroku CLI to your account by writing the following command in your terminal and follow the instructions on the command line:

```
heroku login
```

Then start a remote Heroku project, which is similar to starting a GitHub git repository. With a random name, a project will be created on Heroku as a result. You must provide your own name, such as "Heroku create project-name," if you want to name your programme.

```
heroku create my-cool-project
```

Push your app to Heroku:

```
git push heroku master
```

Visit your newly created app by opening it via [heroku](https://famous-quotes-project.herokuapp.com/quotes):

```
heroku open
```

For debugging if something went wrong:

```
heroku logs --tail
```
