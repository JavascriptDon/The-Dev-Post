**FTX** is the most recent example of the instability of cryptocurrencies, following in the footsteps of **Voyager** and **Three Arrows Capital**.

It moved from being the industry's prospective rescuer, orchestrating rescues of failing enterprises, to needing a bailout itself in less than a week.

This post will go over the events that have impacted **FTX** this month.

## Nov 02, 2022
Reports come to light that **FTX's** cash is based mostly on **FTT**, it's own centrally controlled token.

## Nov 06, 2022
**Binance** CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and **FTX** CEO Sam Bankman-fried have an argie bargie. Binance says it plans to pull out of **FTT**.

## Nov 08, 2022
**Binance** offers a bailout. **Binance** appears to have fallen in love quickly, as it signed a nonbinding letter of intent to acquire its smaller rival.

## Nov 09, 2022
Love was short-lived. After a "business due diligence" review found problems with **FTX's** financial status that **Binance** said were "beyond our control or ability to help," **Binance** swiftly changed course and withdrew from the purchase.

The **Securities and Exchange Commission** and the **Commodity Futures Trading Commission** started looking into the company's connections to sibling companies Alameda Research and **FTX US**, along with claims that it mishandled customer funds, in addition to its liquidity crisis.

**FTX's** bad luck spreads to the rest of the crypto industry.

## Nov 10, 2022
Alameda Research falls.

According to Reuters, **FTX** is now looking for $9.4 billion in rescue cash from investors, as many customers have sold their stakes. Bankman-Fried was apparently in talks with rival exchange **OKX** and stablecoin maker **Tether** to raise funds. He also solicited capital from current **FTX** investors, such as **Sequoia Capital**. He did, however, reach an agreement with **Justin Sun**, the founder of blockchain network **Tron**, to allow Tron-related token holders to remove their holdings from **FTX**.

Trading may be suspended on **FTX US** in a few days, despite Bankman-Fried claiming in a **Twitter** thread that the exchange "was not financially damaged by this shitshow" and was "100% liquid." Any positions you wish to close, kindly do so. Withdrawals are still possible and will be.

## Nov 11, 2022
**FTX** files for chapter 11 bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried steps down.
